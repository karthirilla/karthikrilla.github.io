# Analog Line Follower Robot

## Overview

The **Analog Line Follower Robot** is a classic robotics project designed **without using any microcontroller or digital programming**. This project is entirely built using **analog electronic components**, such as op-amps, comparators, logic gates, relays, and motor drivers. It effectively follows a predefined line (usually black on a white surface) using basic sensor inputs and analog electronics logic.

This design is cost-effective, robust, and a great demonstration of fundamental electronics and robotics principles.

## System Components

1. **Sensors**:
   - Light-dependent resistors (LDRs) or photodiodes detect line contrast.
   - Sensors generate analog voltage based on light intensity.

2. **Op-Amp LM358**:
   - Configured as a **comparator** to compare sensor output voltage with a reference voltage.
   - Determines line position and generates high/low signals accordingly.

3. **Logic Gates**:
   - Used to implement the control logic for motor movement:
     - AND, OR, and NOT gates process comparator outputs.

4. **Relays**:
   - **DPDT Relays**: Switch motor direction (forward/reverse).
   - **DPST Relays**: Enable or disable motor power.

5. **Motor Drivers**:
   - Simple driver circuit for controlling two DC motors for movement.

6. **Zener Diodes**:
   - Used for voltage regulation to protect analog components.

7. **Mechanical Structure**:
   - Chassis to mount components, motors, and wheels.

## Working Principle

1. **Line Detection**:
   - The LDRs or photodiodes detect light reflected from the surface.
   - Black lines reflect less light, generating a **low voltage** signal.
   - White surfaces reflect more light, generating a **high voltage** signal.

2. **Comparator Circuit (LM358)**:
   - The analog voltage from the sensors is compared with a reference voltage.
   - Outputs a **high (1)** or **low (0)** signal based on the comparison.

3. **Logic Control**:
   - Logic gates process the comparator outputs to determine whether the robot should move forward, turn left, or turn right.

4. **Relay Control**:
   - **DPDT relays** control motor direction (left or right turn).
   - **DPST relays** turn the motors on or off.

5. **Motor Movement**:
   - Motors adjust their direction and speed to follow the line:
     - **Move Forward**: When both sensors detect the line.
     - **Turn Left**: When the left sensor goes off the line.
     - **Turn Right**: When the right sensor goes off the line.

## Hardware Circuit Design

The key circuits include:

### 1. **Sensor Circuit**

### 4. **Relay Control**
- **DPDT and DPST relays** switch motor polarity and power supply to control motor movement.

### 5. **Motor Driver Circuit**
- Simple H-Bridge configuration using relays to drive the two DC motors.
